# Drinks
## Overview
Android app to predict how many drinks will be needed for a dinner or cocktail function.

Simply enter the number of guests, the function type (Dinner, Dinner with pre-dinner cocktails, lunch, breakfast) and the duration in hours to receive an estimate of how many bottles of each type of drink will be required.

## Inspiration / Motivation

The inspiration for this app came from my previous work in the catering industry. When functions are to be held in remote areas where immediate access to a bar is not available, the beverages for the function need to be arranged before hand and made available in the function room when it starts, a tool such as this can help remove much of the guesswork from the process.

### NOTE: This app was a personal project and is in an unfinished state.

## Requirements

- The app should provide good accurate estimates for the beverage requirements of an average function so as to minimise waste while ensuring that no particular beverage runs out of supply completely.
- The app should be able to receive feedback on its accuracy so as to improve future estimates.
- The app should be able to offer some preset variations and allow for user customised functions as well, for example preset variations to standard estimates could be: 
  - functions where no alcohol is to be served 
  - functions where sugar drinks are to be limited and more sugar-free drinks required. 
  - User customised functions could be for example a winemakers function where much less beer is consumed than the average function and more wine is consumed insted.
- Where a user creates a customised function, the app should allow them to name it and date it and optionally provide a frequency of recurrance, the next year (or based on the frequency set) if the same user asks for similar function with similar numbers and duration around a similar time of the year then the app can prompt the user if it is the same function as last year and then offer up consumption figures from the previous year.
- The app should be able to remember actual consumption rates for notable recurring functions so as to build a historical profile of a particular function to act as a record both for the user in subsequent years and to refine future estimates for that function.
- The app should allow for custom drinks to be added to it in addition to the standard ones preset.
- The app should allow for its state to be backed up to a portable standard format.
- The app should allow for its state to be restored based on a back up file in an appropriate format.
